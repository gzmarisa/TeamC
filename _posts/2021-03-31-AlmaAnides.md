# Alma Anides on reproducibility

1. Have each team member write a paragraph on tools or concepts learned through FOSS and how they might apply to their field of study. In this paragraph, please address the following questions:
    * Which tool could you apply right away and why?
    * What is your greatest barrier to these tools?
    * What tools would you wish we covered more in depth?
