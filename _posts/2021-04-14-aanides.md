title: "Group Answers Questions on Reproducibility"
---
Of the tools, technologies, and concepts weâ€™ve covered, 
1) Which of these things could you apply right away or are most interested in applying?
- Across our different disciplines, we believe containers seem to be a tool we can all benefit from.  They are lightweight and allow for reproducibility.
- Allows for integration of different scripts with interconnected output and input files into a stable environment.

- Data Management Tools: Data Stewardship (DS) Wizard is useful because it forces the user to answer detailed questions about data mangement and provides a template.
- Evaluates the DMP against FAIR principles across different dimmensions and how you could improve.

- Github:
- Share code among lab team members
- Share code for publications
- Host websites
- Synchronize latex overleaf code 

- Atmosphere:
- virtual machine that expands capabilities compared to our own computers
- allows for collaboration so others can use it

2) What is the greatest barrier to applying/implementing?
- time limitations
- teaching others lab members who may not be familiar with these tools

3) What topic or skill that we covered in FOSS do you wish you had gotten more opportunities to practice or repeat?
